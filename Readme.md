# Data Structures and its Applications (DSA) Code Notebook (Aug-Dec Semester 3, 2024)

## Overview

This folder serves as my **personal code notebook** for the **Data Structures and its Applications (DSA)** course during the **Aug-Dec Semester 3, 2024**. It contains a mix of personal practice code, university-provided materials, and other resources to aid my learning process.

### Important Notes:

- The **Unit X** directories (Unit 1 to Unit 4) contain **Professor provided university material**.
- The other folders, such as **Hackathon** and **MyPracticeCode**, are for my **personal projects and experimentation**.
- The code in **MyPracticeCode** and other non-university folders may be **unoptimized**, **incomplete**, or **experimental**. Please use it **with caution**.

## Repository Structure

### Main Folders:

1. **AllFacultyCodeFolder**  
   Consolidates all code examples and references provided by the faculty during the course. A reliable source for verified content.

2. **Hackathon**  
   Contains code snippets, algorithms, or projects specifically developed during hackathons related to DSA concepts.

3. **MyPracticeCode**  
   A personal sandbox for exploring and practicing DSA concepts. This includes experimental implementations, custom solutions, and alternative approaches to problems.

4. **Unit X (Unit 1 to Unit 4)**  
   Professor-provided material, categorized by course units. Each unit folder focuses on specific topics in DSA:

   - **Unit 1**:

     - Linked List
     - Stack

   - **Unit 2**:

     - Queue
     - Binary Trees

   - **Unit 3**:

     - Applications of Trees
     - Basics of Graphs

   - **Unit 4**:
     - Applications of Graph
     - Hashing
     - Trie
     - Suffix Trees

## Purpose

The primary objectives of this repository are to:

- Organize course-related materials for efficient study and reference.
- Develop a deeper understanding of DSA concepts through hands-on coding and experimentation.
- Document my journey of learning, practicing, and mastering key data structure topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and algorithms.

## Disclaimer

This repository is **not intended for submission or official use**. It is a personal learning resource, and as such:

- Some examples in **MyPracticeCode** or **Hackathon** may not follow best practices.
- Debugging or optimization may still be required for personal code.

For accurate and verified course content, refer to the **Unit X** folders or the **AllFacultyCodeFolder**.
